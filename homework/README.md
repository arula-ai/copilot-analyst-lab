## Getting Started

### Step 1: Review Workshop Materials
Before starting homework, review:
- `SESSION_GUIDE.md` - Refresh on what you learned
- `reference/RIFCC_FRAMEWORK.md` - Advanced prompting techniques
- `reference/GLOSSARY.md` - Technical terms reference

### Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
1. Ensure GitHub Copilot Chat is active
2. Have the homework folder open in VS Code
3. Review the data files to understand what you're working with

### Step 3: Start with Exercise 1
Open `EXERCISE_1_Advanced_COBOL.md` and follow the instructions.

---

## Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Use RIFCC Framework** - Structure every prompt with Role, Inputs, Format, Constraints, Checks
- **Validate Everything** - Don't trust Copilot's output without testing
- **Document Assumptions** - Note what you're assuming in your analysis
- **Iterate on Prompts** - If you don't get good results, refine your prompt
- **Save Work Frequently** - Save your progress as you go

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- **Don't Rush** - Quality matters more than speed
- **Don't Skip Validation** - Always test SQL queries and verify calculations
- **Don't Copy Without Understanding** - Make sure you understand what Copilot generated
- **Don't Use Real Data** - Only use the provided synthetic datasets
- **Don't Work in Isolation** - If stuck, review workshop materials or ask for help

---

## Need Help?

### Resources
- **Workshop Materials** - Review `SESSION_GUIDE.md`, `QUICK_START.md`
- **Reference Guides** - Check `/reference/` directory
- **Sample Prompts** - See `SESSION_GUIDE.md` for examples
- **Glossary** - Look up technical terms in `reference/GLOSSARY.md`

### Common Issues

**Problem:** Copilot isn't giving good responses  
**Solution:** Refine your prompt using RIFCC framework. Be more specific.

**Problem:** SQL query doesn't work  
**Solution:** Ask Copilot to explain the query, then test on small dataset first.

**Problem:** Don't understand COBOL code  
**Solution:** Ask Copilot to explain in plain English, then ask for specific sections.

**Problem:** Not sure if work is correct  
**Solution:** Ask Copilot to create test cases or validation queries.
