# Exercise 4: Quality Review and Governance

## Learning Objectives
- Apply critical review skills to identify errors in technical deliverables
- Practice quality assurance processes for client-facing documents
- Develop error detection techniques using systematic review methods
- Master change documentation and version control procedures
- Build governance mindset for professional consulting environments

## Time Estimate: 30 minutes

## Overview
You will review three intentionally flawed deliverables created by a "junior analyst" and identify all errors, inconsistencies, and quality issues. This exercise simulates real-world quality review processes where senior analysts must catch errors before client delivery.

## Scenario
A junior analyst has submitted the following deliverables for client review. As the senior reviewer, you must identify all issues and create corrected versions. The client meeting is tomorrow, so accuracy and completeness are critical.

## Files to Review

### 1. Flawed Requirements Document
**File**: `/homework/flawed_deliverables/flawed_requirements.md`
**Issues to Find**: 
- Missing sections required by client
- Inconsistent terminology and definitions
- Incomplete business rules and validation logic
- Formatting and structure problems
- Technical inaccuracies and impossibilities

### 2. Flawed SQL Queries
**File**: `/homework/flawed_deliverables/flawed_queries.sql`
**Issues to Find**:
- Syntax errors that prevent execution
- Logic errors producing incorrect results
- Performance issues with inefficient queries
- Missing business logic and edge cases
- Inconsistent naming conventions

### 3. Flawed Data Mapping
**File**: `/homework/flawed_deliverables/flawed_data_map.md`
**Issues to Find**:
- Incorrect data type mappings
- Missing fields and incomplete coverage
- Logical inconsistencies in relationships
- Inadequate validation rules
- Unclear or ambiguous specifications

```

### For Data Mapping Validation:
```
**Role**: Data Architecture Specialist with expertise in system integration and data migration
**Input**: Data mapping specification for legacy system modernization project
**Format**: Comprehensive validation report with corrected mappings and quality assessment
**Context**: Critical data migration requiring 100% accuracy and zero data loss
**Constraints**: Must ensure complete field coverage, accurate transformations, and data integrity

Validate this data mapping document for:
1. Complete coverage of all source system fields
2. Accurate data type conversions and precision handling
3. Proper relationship mappings and referential integrity
4. Adequate business rule validation and error handling
5. Clear transformation logic for calculated fields
6. Compliance with data governance standards

Document all errors with specific corrections and provide recommendations for data quality assurance.
```
